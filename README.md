iThoughtsX serves professionals and students who think visually and benefit from seeing relationships between ideas graphically. The cross-platform availability ensures maps remain accessible everywhere.

Cross-platform synchronization keeps maps consistent across Mac, iOS, and Windows versions. Start mapping on Mac, continue on iPhone, and present from iPad without manual file transfer.

Export formats include PDF, image formats, OPML, and compatibility with other mind mapping applications. Share maps with collaborators regardless of their preferred mind mapping software.

Presentation mode displays maps for meetings and discussions with focus controls highlighting specific branches. Navigate maps during presentations without showing editing interface.

Keyboard navigation enables rapid map creation without mouse dependence. Power users build maps quickly through keyboard shortcuts that accelerate common operations.

Templates provide starting points for common map types. Meeting agendas, project plans, and other standard structures begin from pre-built templates.
